    "authors": "Dr. Amanda Thompson, Prof. David Lee",
    "publication_year": 2023,
    "abstract": "This study investigates the current state of digital literacy among university students and faculty, identifying key challenges and proposing strategies for improvement.",
    "full_text": "Digital literacy has become a critical skill in higher education, yet many institutions struggle to adequately prepare students and faculty for the digital demands of modern academia. This research examines the current state of digital literacy in higher education institutions, identifying gaps in knowledge and skills among both students and faculty members. Through surveys and interviews conducted across multiple universities, we found that while most students are comfortable with basic digital tools, many lack advanced skills in areas such as data analysis, online collaboration, and digital research methods. The study proposes a comprehensive framework for improving digital literacy that includes curriculum integration, faculty development programs, and student support services. Our recommendations focus on practical, implementable strategies that can be adapted to different institutional contexts.",
